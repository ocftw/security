# :lucide-smartphone-charging: Helix Malicious Traffic Monitoring

Taiwan’s unique geopolitical position has subjected it to persistent cyberattacks and threats. Civil society groups on the front lines of defending democracy and freedom are no exception. How can we help civic and advocacy organizations enhance their cybersecurity awareness and basic defensive capabilities?

Helix is a service designed specifically for civic groups to raise cybersecurity awareness. By routing devices through a VPN connection for 72 hours and inspecting network traffic for anomalies or malicious activity, it provides a comprehensive device traffic analysis report.

## Who it’s for

- Civil society and advocacy groups
- Independent media outlets and journalist teams: investigative reporting, fact-checking, newsrooms, and independent media teams
- Legal aid and victim-support organizations: legal assistance, whistleblower support, humanitarian relief/refugee assistance
- Temporary or cross-border collaboration teams: social movement coalitions, international cooperation projects, overseas offices

Or if any of the following apply:

- Distributed (no fixed office) or remote work; frequent use of personal devices (BYOD); heavy reliance on cloud services
- Handling sensitive data (personal data, donations, beneficiary information, sources)
- Past incidents of phishing, account compromise, malware, or anomalous traffic
- Need to demonstrate basic security governance to donors or comply with regulations (e.g., personal data protection laws)

!!! warning "Less suitable scenarios"

    - Large organizations with mature security operations (SOC/SIEM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) already in place
    - Highly restricted or air-gapped networks, or environments where any traffic or behavior monitoring is not permitted
    - Lack of basic operations/response staffing, making it impossible to implement follow-up improvements in the short term

## What’s required

- Willingness to establish data protection and anonymization guidelines
- Designate an information security point of contact (POC) and arrange participant instructions
- Define incident reporting and response procedures
