## How to apply

- If your organization works in human rights, civil society, journalism, or democracy, you can apply to the Galileo project to receive Cloudflare’s cybersecurity protection for free. Submit the application via the official page ([Apply Now](https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/){target="_blank"}).
- The Open Culture Foundation is a Cloudflare Galileo partner. After you apply, we will confirm and evaluate your application before approval.

## Privacy and principles

- To prevent participants from being targeted or retaliated against, Cloudflare will not publicly disclose Galileo participants without explicit permission.
- Referral and approval by partners do not constitute Cloudflare’s endorsement of all of their diverse positions.

## Why it’s worth applying

Many such organizations have limited resources yet frequently face cyberattacks from powerful adversaries. The free protections provided by Galileo can effectively reduce the impact of attacks and maintain service availability and content accessibility (CDN).

If you have any questions about the application, please email <ssd@ocf.tw>.
