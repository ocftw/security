Taiwan’s open-source communities are renowned internationally, and civil society is highly active. However, many organizations still lack cybersecurity resources in the face of escalating digital risks. To promote exchange and collaboration between the open-source community and civil society, the Open Culture Foundation (OCF) International Exchange Team, together with the Chinese Democracy College, the Hacks In Taiwan Association (HITCON), and the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, jointly launched Civil Society Cyber Shield (CSCS) in 2017. CSCS helps civil society and public-interest organizations adopt practical security tools, respond to cybersecurity threats, and build safer online work environments.

Support offerings:

1. Cybersecurity training: Needs-driven programs covering fundamentals, network basics, computer and mobile security, and account and authentication practices. Advanced custom topics can be arranged, such as hands-on demonstrations of hacker surveillance techniques. Training combined with device checkups is recommended to maximize effectiveness.
2. Device checkups: Instructors guide reviews of computers, phones, and shared organizational equipment (e.g., Wi‑Fi access points, printers, network-attached storage), providing configuration recommendations and step-by-step instruction.
3. Security incident consultation: Recommendations for handling urgent or routine incidents (e.g., website intrusions, account takeovers). Ongoing operations and managed services are not provided; related work must be handled in-house or outsourced.

## How to Apply and Who It’s For

1. If you have the above needs, please email <contact@cscs.asia>. CSCS will discuss course or checkup details with your organization’s IT lead or relevant supervisor.
2. For first-time contact, please allow about 1–2 months for needs assessment and agenda design. In urgent cases, we will do our best to expedite our response.
3. This service is available to nonprofit legal entities in Taiwan or internationally, as well as individual practitioners in human rights and other public-interest fields.

## Fees and Response Principles

1. Most cybersecurity instructors are volunteers; a modest honorarium may be charged depending on the case and beneficiary. If affordability is an issue, please email us to discuss a reduction or waiver.
2. Due to limited capacity, we cannot guarantee acceptance of all requests or specific response times. Thank you for your understanding.

## Long-Term Mindset and Responsibilities

1. Cybersecurity is like health management: it cannot be fully improved with a single training session or one-time checkup, nor can zero future risk be guaranteed.
2. We recommend incorporating security maintenance into daily processes and budgets and continuously tracking improvements. When providing assistance, CSCS will, in principle, make recommendations oriented toward long-term improvement.
