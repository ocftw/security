# :lucide-book-text: CSOs Digital Security Handbook｜Beginner’s Guide for Civil Society Organizations

In today’s world where nearly all work is online, civil society groups and organizations rely on digital tools for administration, fundraising, outreach, and external communications. The associated risks and threats have risen accordingly. The Open Culture Foundation’s 2024 survey found that all 35 interviewed human rights and democracy organizations had experienced digital attacks, including surveillance, confidential data leaks, malicious disruption, and information manipulation, and had even faced cross-border repression—causing tangible harm to people and to their voices. Internews’ field experience also shows that getting the basics right can significantly reduce risk.

This handbook is an introductory digital security resource designed for civil society organizations and human rights workers, and it is also suitable for self-study by general readers. Its goal is to help you build core concepts, identify threats, and implement practical management processes and tools to protect your most important assets.
