# :lucide-hat-glasses: Privacy Guides

Privacy Guides is a public-interest–driven website that provides practical information on how to protect your data security and privacy. Privacy Guides is a nonprofit project whose mission is to communicate the importance of digital privacy to the public and to track policies and developments worldwide related to governments’ attempts to monitor your online activity. The site carries no advertising and has no affiliation or commercial relationships with the service providers it lists.

In 2025, the [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/) invested resources to support translation and localization of content into Traditional Chinese (Taiwan usage). The privacy tools and software curated by Privacy Guides are very helpful to our work promoting open source and helping civil society groups strengthen privacy protections. Therefore, we decided to collaborate with community partners to carry out the related translation and localization work.
